# Mission Statement

The main focus is not to create a complete knowledge base, but to develop a clear direction for self-study.

For this reason, the contents are kept short and concise. All external sources are referenced.

Open queries are often provided as a link to motivate the reader, at his discretion, to create his own knowledge.

The aim is to provide information with visual, audio and textual content.

Please in case of broken links, comments and feedback create an [issue](https://github.com/Future-of-Computational-Neuroscience/foundations/issues).
